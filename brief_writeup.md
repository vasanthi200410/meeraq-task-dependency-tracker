# Brief Write-up

## Circular Dependency Detection
I used DFS with a recursion stack to detect circular dependencies when adding a new task dependency.

## Most Challenging Part
Synchronizing backend dependency logic with frontend UI updates and ensuring correct task status propagation.

## Improvements
- Drag-and-drop graph UI
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Improved graph layout algorithm
